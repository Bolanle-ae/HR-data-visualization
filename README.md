**Unveiling Insights into HR Data with Power BI**

Here, we will explore a comprehensive HR data visualization that I've crafted using Power BI. This visualization provides an in-depth look into various aspects of the organization's workforce, from gender distribution and service years to promotion eligibility, retrenchment risks, and departmental insights.

The first page of the HR data visualization offers a broad overview of the workforce, emphasizing key metrics that influence the HR decisions.

We delve into the distribution of service years among the employees, helping us understand the experience levels within the organization.

**Active Workers vs. Retrenchment Risk**

By distinguishing between active workers and those due for retrenchment, we take a proactive approach to workforce management.

We categorize employee commuting distances into three groups: very close, close, and very far, providing valuable information for location-based decision-making.

This section breaks down employees into those due for promotion and those not eligible, helping us focus the HR efforts.
